# filterdsl
FilterDSL is a transport-agnostic domain-specific language for expressing complex filter criteria as a shared contract between clients and APIs. It defines syntax and semantics only, independent of HTTP, WebSockets, or execution, enabling validation, reuse, and translation across systems.
